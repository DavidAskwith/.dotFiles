.dotFiles
=========

This repository contains all the file used in my custom Debian system install.

I have included configuration files for the following components of my system.

1. Bash
2. i3
3. Vim
4. RXVT
5. Network Manager

The repository also includes fonts and a background image for the configuration. 

I have created two initialization scripts the first is used to symbolic link the configuration files and the second is used to install the programs necessary for the system install.

During the next clean install of my system I will be creating a fully hands series of modularized install scripts
